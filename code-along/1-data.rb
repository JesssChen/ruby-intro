# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts-> short cut of output
# puts 5
# puts 2

# puts 5+2
# puts 5*2
# puts 5-2
# puts 5/2
# #can only have integer, in order to get remainder, need to get decimal like:
# puts 5/2.0
# puts 1/3.0


# Non-numbers
puts "Hello, Worlds"
puts "Tacos are not" + " delish"
puts "tacos" *3
#puts 3*"tacos" #make no sense

# True, False

puts true
puts false 

puts 3==2

# Nothing

# Variables
zebra=5
giraffe=2


puts zebra+giraffe

food="tacos"
quantity=3
puts food*quantity 

# Combine strings and variables

puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"
name="Jessica"
puts "Hello, #{name}!"

# String manipulation
